#1. calculate pearson correlation coefficient between trees$Girth and trees$volume of default trees dataset in R
#Pl mention what you draw from correlation coefficient

cor(trees$Girth,trees$Volume)  #0.9671194
trees$Girth and trees$Volume are postively correlated.


#6.use Bartlettâ€™s test to determine whether the variance in weight is the same for all treatment groups in PlantGrowth DataSet?
View(PlantGrowth)
bartlett.test(PlantGrowth$weight, PlantGrowth$group)  #p-value = 0.2371

#The null Hypothesis we assume the sample have Equal Variance and Alternate Hypothesis state that atleast one sample have 
#significantly different variance.We reject null Hypothesis if p<0.05.

#Here we reject the Null Hypothesis and we can conclude that variance in weight is not same across all the treatment group.
