#6.use Bartlettâ€™s test to determine whether the variance in weight is the same for all treatment groups in PlantGrowth DataSet?

View(PlantGrowth)
bartlett.test(PlantGrowth$weight, PlantGrowth$group)  #p-value = 0.2371

#The null Hypothesis we assume the sample have Equal Variance and Alternate Hypothesis state that atleast one sample have 
#significantly different variance.We reject null Hypothesis if p<0.05
